## Abstract

The main purpose of this work is to design an Angular Space Repetitive Control (ASRC) for an Active Power Filter (APF) in a single-phase system subjected to a nonlinear load (filtered full-wave rectifier) in order to make it robust to grid frequency deviations. A summary of the principal scientific publications referred to the topics of Repetitive Control (RC) and Angular Space Repetitive Control (ASRC) is dispensed alongside with a brief synthesis of the proposed control techniques for APFs. The paramount concepts of RC and ASRC are introduced. Posterior to this, a modeling of the plant is performed in both time-domain and angular space domain based on which the control architecture is formulated. Since the ASRC demands a constant number of samples per period, a Power-Based Phase-Locked Loop (pPLL)-based testing platform is designed and tested in a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). To conclude. simulation results on Simulink are presented for diverse frequency scenarios.
