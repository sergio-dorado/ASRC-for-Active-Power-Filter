# Design andSimulation of an Angular Spatial Repetitive Controller for an Active Power Filter Application

The main purpose of this work is to design an Angular Space Repetitive Control (ASRC) for an Active Power Filter (APF) in a single-phase system subjected to a nonlinear load (filtered full-wave rectifier) in order to make it robust to grid frequency deviations. A summary of the principal scientific publications referred to the topics of Repetitive Control (RC) and Angular Space Repetitive Control (ASRC) is dispensed alongside with a brief synthesis of the proposed  control techniques for APFs. The paramount concepts of RC and ASRC are introduced. Pos- terior to this, a modelling of the plant is performed in both time-domain and angular space  domain based on which the control architecture is formulated. Since the ASRC demands a con- stant number of samples per period, a Power-Based Phase-Locked Loop (pPLL)-based testing  platform is designed and tested in a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). To conclude. simulation results on Simulink are presented for diverse frequency scenarios.
